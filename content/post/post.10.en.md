**Designing a Website - Hypertext Mockup Language**


The Rock Band Online Shop project was undertaken to help a popular rock band create a web presence for selling their music and branded merchandise. As a web developer, I was tasked with translating the band's design vision into functional web pages using HTML and CSS.


**Crickey - The Ultimate Cricket Discord Bot**

The primary objective of the "Crickey" bot project was to create a feature-rich Discord bot that delivers real-time cricket match updates and engages users in cricket-related discussions.

To bring "Crickey" to life, I utilized the following technologies and tools:


1. Web Scraping: Web scraping techniques were used to crawl cricket websites for real-time data.


2. Interactive Commands: Custom interactive commands were designed to provide a lively user experience.
