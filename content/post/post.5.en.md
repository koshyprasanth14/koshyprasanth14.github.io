**SETTING UP HUGO**

First things first, I needed to set up Hugo on my local machine.I installed hugo into my system, and I followed the official Hugo installation guide to ensure I had the latest version installed.


Hugo offers a variety of website themes. After browsing a lot i found out a perfect theme that matched my minimalist style. Unfortunately, I messed up so much that I got frustrated and deleted all the work i had done ðŸ˜†.

A few days later i made a new site with a new theme after watching a really long video which detiled how to make a website using hugo and host it using netlify. 

This time the errors were a lot less, and i almost finished adding content to my webiste. Then i learnt how to host the website using github pages. 

This time, the website which was made public didnt show the design of the theme. guessing that it was the problem with the theme like the previous time, i made another website using a third theme, which was a little more popular.

But even this time the design was not appearing, and only after geetting help from a senior in amFOSS club was a able to know that i had to create a workflow file inorder for the github.io site to show the design.

after spending a lot of time, I finnaly got it working ðŸ˜Œ


In just a few steps (but a lot of time due to my inexperience), I was able to create a stunning portfolio website using Hugo and host it on GitHub Pages. Hugo's simplicity and flexibility made the process enjoyable, and I was able to customize the website to reflect my creativity and style.
